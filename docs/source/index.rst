The plate-simulation application is a tool for simulating geohpysical data over
halspace + overburden + plate geology.  It relies on the `discretize <https://discretize.simpeg.xyz/en/main/>`_
and `SimPEG <https://simpeg.xyz/>`_ projects to create a refined octree mesh and
simulate data over the parameterized model.  The mesh, model and simulation
details are parameterized in a ui.json file that can be rendered in
`Geoscience ANALYST Pro <https://www.mirageoscience.com/mining-industry-software/geoscience-analyst-pro/>`_.

to learn more about the application, read on.
